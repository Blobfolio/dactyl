This crate provides a fast interface to "stringify" unsigned integers, formatted with commas at each thousand. It prioritizes speed and simplicity over configurability.

If your application just wants to quickly turn `1010` into `"1,010"`, `Dactyl` is a great choice. If your application requires locale awareness or other options, something like [`num-format`](https://crates.io/crates/num-format) would probably make more sense.

Similar to [`itoa`](https://crates.io/crates/itoa), Dactyl writes ASCII conversions to a temporary buffer, but does so using fixed arrays sized for each type's maximum value, minimizing the allocation overhead for, say, tiny little `u8`s.

Each type has its own struct, each of which works exactly the same way:

* [`NiceU8`]
* [`NiceU16`]
* [`NiceU32`]
* [`NiceU64`]

(Note: support for `usize` values is folded into [`NiceU64`].)

The intended use case is to simply call the appropriate `from()` for the type, then use either the `as_str()` or `as_bytes()` struct methods to retrieve the output in the desired format. Each struct also implements traits like `Deref`, `Display`, `AsRef<str>`, `AsRef<[u8]>`, etc., if you prefer those.

```rust
use dactyl::NiceU16;

assert_eq!(NiceU16::from(11234_u16).as_str(), "11,234");
assert_eq!(NiceU16::from(11234_u16).as_bytes(), b"11,234");
```



## Installation

Add `dactyl` to your `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`, like:

```
[dependencies]
dactyl = "0.4.*"
```



## Other

This crate also contains a few more specialized "nice" structs:
* [`NiceFloat`]
* [`NiceElapsed`]
* [`NicePercent`]
