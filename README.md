# Dactyl

This crate contains helpers to format unsigned integers as "pretty" byte strings with commas marking each thousand. To that singular end, they are much faster than using the `format!` macro or an external crate like [`num_format`].

To minimize unnecessary allocation, structs are split up by type:

* [`NiceU8`]
* [`NiceU16`]
* [`NiceU32`]
* [`NiceU64`]

Note: [`NiceU64`] implements both `from<u64>` and `from<usize>`, so can be used for either type.

Working on a similar idea, there is also [`NicePercent`], which implements `from<f32>` and `from<f64>` to convert values between `0..=1` to a "pretty" percent byte string, like `75.66%`.

Last but not least, there is [`NiceElapsed`], which converts numerical time into a human-readable, oxford-joined byte string, like `1 hour, 2 minutes, and 3 seconds`.



## Stability

Release versions of this library should be in a working state, but as this project is under perpetual development, code might change from version to version.



## Installation

Add `dactyl` to your `dependencies` in `Cargo.toml`, like:

```
[dependencies.dactyl]
git = "https://github.com/Blobfolio/dactyl.git"
tag = "v0.1.*"
```
